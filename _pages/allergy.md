OpenFind can scan nutrition labels and help you look out for ingredients. Here's a demo video.

### Find ingredients

OpenFind has no problem picking out "Flour" even though the text is super small.

### Point-and-scan

Just point your phone at the label and matching words will get highlighted.

### Make custom ingredient lists

Here's a list containing a bunch of dairy-related ingredients.

### Comes with 10+ lists preloaded

Ingredients are pulled straight from the [Food Allergy Research & Education association](https://www.foodallergy.org/living-food-allergies/food-allergy-essentials/common-allergens). Some extra lists are included too.
