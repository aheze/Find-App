<h2>Description</h2>
</div>

Find is an app to find text in real life. Look for text anywhere, whether that’s in screenshots, books, or even nutrition labels — all in real time. Search your entire photo library in a split second and organize it with stars. Find in real-time using the camera and speed through forms and worksheets. Create lists of allergies or dietary restrictions and find unwanted ingredients instantly. Find is faster than the human eye.


Find was designed with privacy in mind, so all processes happen offline and nothing ever leaves your phone. There are no servers, no data collection, no analytics, and no internet connection is required.


Find is a free app. It has no ads, subscriptions, or in-app purchases.

<h2>About the Developer</h2>
</div>

I'm Andrew Zheng, an iOS developer living in the SF Bay Area. Besides coding, I like to watch anime and play the piano.

Find is my first and most fully-featured app. I originally built it to help out with school, but I think it's gotten to be pretty useful for stuff beyond that. But anyway, I'm very committed to user privacy. No one likes apps that sell your data. It's the same with outrageous subscriptions and unskippable ads. So, all of my apps don't collect data, have subscriptions, or ads.

You can contact me anytime on [twitter](https://twitter.com/aheze0), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/aheze), or [email](mailto:aheze@getfind.app).
