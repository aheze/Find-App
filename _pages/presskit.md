<h2>Description</h2>
</div>

Find is a fast, focused iOS app that balances speed with awesome capability. It centers on finding text in printed documents, and does it extremely well. It values ease-of-use just as much as the user's privacy, so there are no ads or trackers to disrupt their experience.

Find is completely free and works 100% offline. The Optical Character Recognition that powers its core functionality uses on-device technology that's both fast and accurate. It annihilates the human eye, especially when processing hundreds of photos and yielding results in minutes.

<h2>About the Developer</h2>
</div>

I'm A. Zheng, a developer who like making useful things. I started learning how to code a couple years ago, and after countless Udemy tutorials, I finished my first app, which is — as you might have guessed — Find.

Throughout all that time, I've been committed to user privacy. No one likes apps that sell your data. It's the same with outrageous subscriptions and unskippable ads. I've decided that all of my apps won't collect any data at all. They won't have subscriptions or ads either. I'm not in need of money — instead, it's nice to provide something that people can enjoy. Also, I like how this looks:
