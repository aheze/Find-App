# Press Kit
Help Find grow! It's a pretty small app built by a pretty small team... well, more like a one person team. But, I'm working on it in full confidence. Want to join me in spreading the word?

<h2>Description</h2>
</div>

Find is a fast, focused iOS app that balances speed with awesome capability. Its main feature is to find text in printed documents, and does it extremely well. I value ease-of-use just as much as the user's privacy, so there are no ads or trackers to disrupt their experience.

Find is completely free and works 100% offline. The Optical Character Recognition that powers the core functionality uses on-device technology that's both fast and accurate. It annihilates the human eye, especially when processing hundreds of photos and producing results in seconds.

### Feature Spotlight: Lists
Time is valuable. Leave the repetitive work of struggling through page after page to a machine, which is faster and makes less mistakes. With Lists, Find is more than just <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>.

<details>
<summary>Lists - Group words together. Great for keeping an eye out for dietary restrictions or allergies.</summary>

<h2>About the Developer</h2>
</div>

I'm A. Zheng, a.k.a. aheze, a developer who like making useful things. I started learning how to code a couple years ago, and after a lot of Udemy tutorials, I finished my first app, which is — as you might have guessed — Find.

Throughout all that time, I've been committed to user privacy. No one likes apps that sell your data. It's the same with outrageous subscriptions and unskippable ads. As such, I'm determined to keep all of my apps free of data collection, subscriptions, and ads. I'm not in need of money — I find more purpose in providing something that people can enjoy. 

You can contact me anytime through [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/aheze) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/743230678795288637) DMs, or via [email](mailto:aheze@getfind.app).
