## Privacy Policy

Andrew Zheng built the Find app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Andrew Zheng at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

### Find does not collect any information.
- Find operates **offline**.
    - Exception: If you have iCloud photos that are not stored locally on your device, Find will use Apple's built-in frameworks to *download* these photos. Nothing is ever uploaded.
- Find uses local algorithms for text recognition and **never** uploads your photos.
- Find does **not** contain analytics libraries.
- Find does **not** track you in any way.
- Find does **not** have ads.
- Find does **not** upload your information online.

### Log Data

Find does not contain any crash/analytics libraries.

Whenever you use Find, in a case of an error in the app, Apple may send me the crash log. I only receive this Log Data when you have explicitly chosen to [enable it](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202100) in your iPhone's Privacy settings. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

### Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

Find does not use these "cookies." However, the app may link to external sites that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

### Links to Other Sites

Find may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### Children's Privacy

Find does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone. In the case I discover that someone has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page. You can find the last updated date at the top of this page.
