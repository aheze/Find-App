# Translate Find
Help translate Find!

**Update July 30, 2022**
iOS 16 will introduce text search in Photos, which makes the current version of Find almost useless (I got sherlocked ðŸ˜¢).
So, I'm working on Find v3.0 right now. In about 3 weeks I'll have the base foundation done. ([Sneak peeks on my Twitter](https://twitter.com/aheze0)).
Thanks to those who've signed up already!

**Update May 22, 2022**
I'm still working on gathering all the strings in the app. I should be done in a couple days. In the meantime, join the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Pmq8fYcus2)?

The translation dashboard is already set up (translations are managed through Crowdin) but I haven't uploaded anything to translate yet. You can still [sign up for an account](https://accounts.crowdin.com/register?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fcrowdin.com%2Fproject%2Ffind-app%2Fzh-cn) though!
