###### February 4, 2021
### `Super Major Release`
# **Version 1.2.0**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>It‚Äôs 2021, so we added 21 new features! This is Find‚Äôs biggest update yet. There's so much new stuff that it seems like a different app, but I've listed out everything below.</summary>

#### What's New


1\. Redesigned navigation - instead of a weird floating button, you now get a nice, clean tab bar.

2\. Photos, Camera, and Lists each get their own tab - and you can swipe between them.

3\. Complete user interface overhaul.


**This time, we mainly focused on improving Photos.**

4\. Syncing - Photos is now linked to the built-in Photos app on your phone. This means that you can find from all your existing photos, and not just the ones saved from Find.

5\. Filters - we added a slider where you can switch between the different types of photos, which are:

‚Ä¢ Local - photos saved from Find

‚Ä¢ Starred - photos that you‚Äôve starred (do this for the ones that you view the most)

‚Ä¢ Cached - cached photos, which churn out results instantly when you find from them

‚Ä¢ All - all your photos

6\. Refreshed gallery view - photos are now grouped by month instead of day, and displayed in a 4 column layout to take advantage of all available space

7\. Resumable finding - you can now switch between the gallery view and the finding sheet without losing your place.

8\. Cleaner finding - we polished up all the little shadows and corner radiuses... but also rethought the interaction, so everything is much easier to use.

9\. Universal icons - photos will now have the Star or Cache icon everywhere, whether that‚Äôs in the gallery view, or the finding sheet.

10\. Info sheet - shows the date taken and origin of a photo. Also, for cached photos, you can now copy their transcripts.


**There‚Äôs even more, but let‚Äôs get to Camera.**

11\. Cleaner layout - gone are the popup and rings from 1.1. Now, the shutter button springs out from the tab bar, supported by 2 buttons at the corners. That animation took quite a while to make!

12\. Shutter - we made a bunch of improvements here. Back in 1.1, all it did was take photos. But we realized that people would rather pause the preview, so that‚Äôs what it does now.

13\. But that‚Äôs not all. When you pause the preview, the tab bar is replaced with the Save and Cache buttons.

14\. Press Save to take a photo and save it to the photo library (we actually didn‚Äôt remove this feature!)

15\. You can now also cache directly in the paused preview, getting you faster and more accurate results.


**We redesigned Settings too!**

16\. More modern interface - redesigned to contrast beautifully with the camera, it now has an awesome dark theme.

17\. More settings - we added levels for haptic feedback, so you aren‚Äôt stuck with just ON or OFF. There‚Äôs now also an option to turn off ‚ÄúSwipe to Navigate‚Äù if you don‚Äôt want to swipe between tabs.

18\. Better help center - we‚Äôre now using SupportDocs, which is an open-source project of ours.


**And finally, Lists.**

19\. We brought the design refresh to Lists, too - you‚Äôll get more vivid colors and a more fluid experience.

20\. The icon gallery view now has 8 columns, making it easier to pick the one you want. We‚Äôve also made the header sticky, so you always know which category you‚Äôre browsing.

21\. Code-level improvements - Lists in the previous version had a lot of redundant code. We‚Äôve optimized it for a faster and more efficient program.


Well, that‚Äôs pretty much all! And Find is still completely free with no ads, even almost a year later. Enjoy, and keep the reviews coming!
